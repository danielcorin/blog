[That people produce HTML with string templates is telling us something](https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/programming/OnHTMLViaStringTemplates).
I think about this phenomena often, though I personally find most string template systems that produce HTML difficult to use.
[Django templates](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/templates/), [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/), [Rails ERB](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/layouts_and_rendering.html), Hugo [templates](https://gohugo.io/templates/) just to name a few.
My experience has been these systems are difficult to debug and are practically their own full programming languages.
I think React finds the sweet spot for the challenges that these other systems run into.
React can still be difficult to debug but it feels much more like you're writing the thing that will be rendered rather than an abstraction on top of that.
