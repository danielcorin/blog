There seemed (seems) to be palpable negativity on Twitter (X), that Twitter's users want it to continue to stumble and fail after the new owner took over the company even though they loved Twitter just because they did not like or agree with the new owner.

The new owner's buying of Twitter ruined Twitter for them.
They wanted (and expected) it to fail since he's taken over.
A large number of people on the site turned against it in an attempt to reject his capture of a thing they loved.
People said Twitter was over, that it would disappear from the internet and that the site quite literally could not stay online due to the decisions the new owner was making (I recall some rumour that he quite literally entered a server room and unplugged racks to save money).
It has been a sort of comedy-bordering-on-bloodsport, where you often can't tell who is telling a joke and who (if anyone) is being genuine.
On any given day, it seems either could be true.
It's possible no one has any idea what anyone else really believes and just cannot stop screaming their heads off about it.

However, Twitter is not dead.
I still read it frequently to learn about the most recent developments in language models.
I see read a bit of sports content, though less than I used to.
The site still lives -- something many big-tech-company employees claimed wouldn't be possible for very long.

After the takeover, many people acted as if they were graduating from school and wouldn't see each other or a long time or ever again.
I haven't see many followups from those who made these predictions, which turned out not to be correct.
I'm interested, what, if anything, they feel they learned from the experience.
In the spirit of transparency, I seem to have been largely [wrong]({{< ref "logs/2023/07/03.md" >}}) about what would happen after Threads launched.
I still don't use Threads yet because I'm unwilling to use it through an app.

For me, this experience has been a welcome reminder not to over-index on a particular moment and maintain a longer term, flexible view of the future.
I think making predictions is a valuable exercise and strive to do it more, with the intention of finding out if I'm right and learning what I missed if I'm wrong.
