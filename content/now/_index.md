_What is a [now page](https://nownownow.com/about)?_

I moved to New York City at the beginning of 2023.
I go to meetups periodically around the area.

I recently became more active on [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/danielcorin.com).

I am currently exploring, focusing on and learning about:

- local models
- embeddings
- [Astro](https://astro.build/)

I am also working on [Delta](https://gist.github.com/danielcorin/fa87f57345d761ab276cbc82c8601171), a conversation branching tool for interacting with LLMs
