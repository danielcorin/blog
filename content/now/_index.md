_What is a [now page](https://nownownow.com/about)?_

I moved to New York City at the beginning of 2023.

I am currently exploring, focusing on and learning about:

- Multi-modal LLMs
- [Temporal](https://temporal.io/)
- System Dependency management with [Nix](https://nixos.org/)

I have specific plans to

- Build a few ML models using learnings from course.fast.ai. These will likely be some random forests. I need to find interesting data sets.
