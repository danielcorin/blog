_What is a [now page](https://nownownow.com/about)?_

I am currently exploring, focusing on and learning about:

- non-chat UXs for interacting with language models
- the limits of vibe coding
- an experimental approach to knowledge synthesis

I recently open sourced [Delta](https://github.com/danielcorin/delta), a tool for branching conversations with LLMs.

I also write interactive articles on [Thought Eddies](https://www.thoughteddies.com/).
