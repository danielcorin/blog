I'm continuing to learn explore broadly rather than with significant depth in an area.
I'm remaining open minded to pivot to depth when the time is right, but nothing has quite captured my imagination in an enduring way.

Current areas of exploration and focus:

- [Temporal](https://temporal.io/)
- [Deno](https://deno.com/)
- [Fast.ai Course](https://course.fast.ai/)
- Bidirectional, voice-first LLM chatbots
- Dependency management with [Nix](https://nixos.org/)

Future plans:

- Running larger models locally now that I have the hardware to do it (probably with [`ollama`](https://ollama.com/))
- Building a few models using learnings from course.fast.ai (likely some random forests, need to find interesting data sets)
