I built a site to take a prompt from a user about where they were and their preferences and from these, would generate an itinerary for their day and plot the proposed locations on a map.
This project was inspired by use of ChatGPT while traveling to easily source points of interest and activities based on the types of things we wanted to do while visiting a new place.

tech: React, Next.js, OpenAI, Vercel
