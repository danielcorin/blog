I built a [site](https://adventure-of-penelope.vercel.app/) to host a language model generated kidâ€™s book I built using ChatGPT and Midjourney. The plot was sourced from my book club to see how a language model would perform writing a story with an unusual plot.
It prompted some interesting conversations about the role of storytelling and art in culture on the [orange website](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34514480).

Tech: React, Next.js, OpenAI, Midjourney, Vercel
