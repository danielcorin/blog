I wrote an [implementation](https://github.com/danielcorin/Hearts) of the Hearts card game towards the end of college to practice Python.
This repo unexpectedly got a bit of traction several years later and has been used as the base project to train and implement an AI player, something I aspired to do when creating the project but never did.

Tech: Python
