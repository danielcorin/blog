I built a [site](https://our-book-club.vercel.app/) to track the books we read in our book club and remind folks what we’re reading for the next week.
I also built some vanity charts to look at stats about what we’ve read over the years.
It’s backed by a Notion database so it’s easy for me to update quickly.
This was one of the first sites I build using React and Next.js, so it's quite basic and I relied a lot of frameworks and prebuilt components.

Tech: React, Next.js, [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/), Notion, Vercel
