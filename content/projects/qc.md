I wrote a little command line utility to do math while doing research over the summer.
It was my [first submission](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6091659) to HN and received a bit of traction.
I also wrote a [post]({{< ref "http://localhost:1313/posts/2013/2013-07-05-qc.md" >}}) about it.

Tech: Python, Shell
