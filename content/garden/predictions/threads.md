title: "‚ùå Migration to Threads"
draft: false

## Prediction
From [logs]({{< ref "logs/2023/07/03.md" >}}):
> Facebook (Meta, whatever) announced Threads today to launch on July 6th.
> Given how much worse it feels like Twitter has become (my experience only), on one hand, I could see people migrating here because no great alternative has really emerged.
> On the other, Facebook has zero "public" products where the user experience is even palatable for me, personally (I use Whatsapp but it's basically iMessage).
> Instagram and Facebook both rapidly became completely intolerable for me due to their content.
> Maybe that is a matter of curation, but I bet, at least in some part, it's a result of how Facebook runs their business and why Twitter never made much ad revenue compared to them (and why Reddit struggles to either).
> If I had to make a bet, I would bet on people migrating to Threads.
> Personally, I won't until they have a webapp.

## Outcome
Incorrect (so far), but not specific enough to be a good prediction
After 6 months, Threads isn't an obvious Twitter replacement.
It seems people have migrated all over to Mastodon, Bluesky, Threads and elsewhere.
Also, I didn't start using Threads.
