My blog has the following sections

## [Posts](/posts)

I view these as complete or polished pieces. They are of varied quality, but
most have been edited by myself several times over and occasionally a few
others.

## [TILs](/til) (short for Today I Learned Posts)

I've seen several other folks write these types of posts. I sort of view them as
notebooks. I write ideas and things I learn in them, but they're only a medium
level of refined at most, and something are just simple, straightforward things.
They usually have a medium amount of editing but quality varies.

## [Logs](/logs)

Logs are short notes, thoughts, links and occasionally tweets. They mostly
capture a few moments in a day. These are thoughts that lead to me writing in
the other sections but are generally unrefined and unedited.

## [About](/about)

Brief and general, high level things about myself.

## [Projects](/projects)

These are specific attempts to build things over the years. Quality varies a
great deal but they the product of ideas I had or things I wanted to try.

## [Garden](/garden)

A place for thoughts, ideas and essays I tend to.

## [Uses](/uses)

The software and hardware I use.

## [Now](/now)

What I am up to "lately".
