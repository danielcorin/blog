Why create a list of the people and things that have influenced and inspired you?

Crediting your inspirations is like leaving a trail behind you as you walk through the wilderness.
This trail allows others to follow in your footsteps, taking similar turns if they seem to lead in an interesting direction.
It allows those who come after you to retrace parts of your path.
By sharing our inspirations, we put up signposts to help others discover new paths.
This practice is particularly valuable in an age of noise, where many are focused on growing their "followings" and selling.

For me, there are few things better than discovering an interesting article, then finding a list of influences of the author.
It's an organic recommendation engine, curated by someone whose work and taste you know you appreciate.
