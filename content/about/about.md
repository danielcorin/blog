Hi ðŸ‘‹

I'm Dan Corin. I'm a software engineer.

This site is a journal of my work, thoughts, readings and learnings.

Lately, I'm spending a lot of time experimenting with language models and ways in which they can be applied in production systems today.

Feel free to reach out if you are interested in connecting or find an error on the site.
